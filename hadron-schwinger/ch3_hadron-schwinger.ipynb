    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will follow the paper above to simulate the propagation (spreading) of a hadron wavepacket in the Schwinger model on an IBM quantum computer. The figure below (Fig. 10 in the paper) illustrates hadron evolution, quantified in terms of the chiral condensate $\\mathcal{X}$ (the left side is a simulation, and the right side is based on real hardware).\n",

    "In the paper, the wavepacket is prepared on a lattice with $L=56$ spatial sites ($2L = 112$ total sites and therefore 112 qubits) and then evolved  up to $t=14$. To keep the required resources more modest for this challenge, we adjusted this to a slightly smaller scale: $L = 34$ (68 qubits) and $t = 8$. Also, we will not simulate all intermediate time snapshots, but instead focus on $t=0$ and $t=8$. **In our hardware experiment, we will try to reproduce the wavepacket's spread at $t=8$, and specifically, the dip in the vacuum-subtracted chiral condensate in the center, with a peak on each side (see the simulated result below for a lattice of $L=34$ spatial sites).**\n",

    "1. Implement code to evolve a hadron wave packet and extract the wave spreading/propagation signal by following directions and filling in code below. Look for the `# PROMPT` marker inside the code boxes to find the places where code needs to be filled in. Where needed, there are specific `# BEGIN ANSWER` and `# END ANSWER` markers as well. Completing the notebook by filling in the prompts will lead to a basic implementation that has a few simplifications relative to the implementation in the paper.\n",

    "  * Investigate real-time benchmarking before mapping the circuit to hardware (see https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/tutorials/real-time-benchmarking-for-qubit-selection)\n",
    "  * Run each circuit on multiple layouts so that errors due to bad qubits average out\n",
    "* Implement alternative error mitigation:\n",
    "  * ZNE\n",
    "  * [TEM](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/algorithmiq-tem)\n",
    "* Quantify the limitations of ODR and the bias induced by it\n",
    "* Vary Trotter step size\n",
    "* Add (additional) readout error mitigation in a way that makes sense (note: the ODR implementation already \"contains\" T-REX readout error mitigation)\n",
    "* Interleave twirls (i.e. for each twirl, run the physics and mitigation circuits back to back using the same twirl realization) and apply post-selection at the twirl-level (as in the paper)\n",
    "* Investigate improvements (if any) from implementing fractional gates\n",

We then correct $Z_j$ for the physics circuit, assuming the same suppression factor. This processing is pre-implemented in the `challenge_utils` module. Some additional notes on ODR:\n",

The approach of forward/backward Trotter evolution implemented above for the mitigation circuits is expected to lead to similar noise models between the physics and mitigation circuits, but does not guarantee them to be identical.\n",
    "  * Despite the above caveats, in practice, ODR is a quite effective error mitigation technique with modest overhead.\n",
    "  * However, because of points (1) and (2), ODR is biased and does not provide control and understanding of its error bars. As we push toward quantum advantage applications, we therefore should use techniques that are unbiased and/or provide rigorous error bars.\n",
