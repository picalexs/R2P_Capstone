    "# Welcome to the Capstone project!\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the final project of the Road to Practitioner (R2P) program. Throughout this program, we have covered the essential topics in quantum computing, including variational algorithms, transpilation and error mitigation techniques, and advance methods such as quantum diagonalization and Hamiltonian simulation. The lectures and the assignments were designed to bring you to the level of a practitioner, which we define as someone capable of executing quantum algorithms independently and reproducing quantum applications at a utility scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to put your knowledge into practice! In the Capstone project, we take a step further by challenging you to reproduce quantum applications at a utility scale for the following applications: quantum optimization, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum diagonalization. This phase is crucial to complete the program since your ability to apply what you have learned and successfully complete difficult challenges will be evaluated.\n",
    "If you pass the Capstone project, you will have demonstrated that you are ready to become a quantum practitioner and tackle new, real-world quantum challenges ahead!"

    "# Guideline on the challenges and scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 challenges, and each one contributes a certain number of points, which are distributed across its exercises. Most exercises use binary grading, i.e. if you pass you earn the full points for that exercise. However, each challenge also includes a final exercise, which is more complex and serves as the culmination of the lab. This exercise is graded in a continuous way, meaning your score depends on the quality of your solution and can range from 0 up to the exercise's maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the challenge deadline, your team will receive a final score based on the total points accumulated by running the notebooks and passing the graders. There is no limit on the number of attempts to try to pass an exercise. Once you pass an exercise, its grade is saved on our server, so you don't need to worry if you accidentally delete your solution later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your total score, teams are classified into the following categories:\n",

    "\n",
    "*Summary:*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we will tackle a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, reformulated as a weighted Max-Cut problem that can be solved by the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In particular your task is to to prepare a suitable ansatz for solving the multi-objective Max-cut problem, first for a problem with 42 qubits and then you will be asked to scale it to 80 qubits.\n",

    "**The maximum grade for this exercise is 100 points**\n",

    "*Summary:*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we will estimate the ground state of a Methylamine, $CH_{3}NH_{2}$  molecule using a Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization with 30 qubits that outperforms Hartree-Fock and CASCI classical solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: Hadron-Schwinger (90 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The maximum grade for this exercise is 90 points**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Summary:*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we will simulate the propagation of a hadron wavepacket in the Schwinger model on an IBM quantum computer, prepared on a lattice with $L=34$ spatial sites (68 qubits). We will start with initial states already prepared by SC-ADAPT-VQE and perform the time evolution of the Hamiltonian using the Suzuki-Trotter algorithm to evolve the initial states forward in time. The circuits will first be executed on a simulator and later on an IBM quantum computer."
